1. macro for a struct to convert To and From an Object (with ObjectShape...)
    object *itself* doesn't have a cardinality, but the fields do
    so each field....

        field: Option<T>
    how do we get cardinality from here?

        struct SomeStruct {fields};

        trait FromObject;
        impl FromObject for SomeStruct;

        trait FromObjectSet: HasCardinality;
        impl FromObjectSet for SomeStruct;
        impl<T> FromObjectSet for Option<T> {}
        impl<T> FromObjectSet for Vec<T> {}
        
2. for a query, we want to have a default cardinality
